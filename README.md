# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-Python

Credit Risk Analysis
Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to credit risk using various machine learning models. The goal is to predict whether an individual is likely to default on a loan, based on features such as income, age, loan amount, and more. The project utilizes techniques like data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Data
The dataset used in this project is credit_risk_dataset.csv. It contains information on various factors influencing credit risk. The key steps in data handling include:

Loading Data: The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Initial Exploration: Basic exploration to understand the structure and content of the data (e.g., .head(), .shape(), .info()).
Feature Engineering
The project involves several feature engineering steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder, and standardizing features using StandardScaler.
Balancing the Dataset: The dataset is balanced using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance.
Modeling
Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated in this project:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
AdaBoost Classifier
Bagging Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Hyperparameter Tuning: The models are tuned using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
ROC-AUC Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report
Results
The best-performing model is identified based on the evaluation metrics. The results are visualized using plots and summarized in the notebook.
